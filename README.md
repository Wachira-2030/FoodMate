## Introduction

## Business Understanding
The food and health industry is a highly competitive and crowded space. With so many diet plans, meal delivery services, and health apps available, it can be overwhelming for individuals to navigate and make informed decisions about their dietary choices. This creates a major business problem for stakeholders who want to provide effective solutions that meet the needs of their customers. One major issue is the lack of personalized nutrition recommendations available in the market. Many existing meal delivery services and health apps provide generic diet plans that are not tailored to an individual's specific needs and preferences. This can lead to frustration and disappointment, as customers may not see the desired results and may eventually give up on their healthy eating goals altogether. Another challenge is the time and effort required to plan and prepare healthy meals. Many individuals lead busy lives and do not have the time or energy to research and create nutritious meals every day. 
This can lead to unhealthy eating habits and may have negative consequences on their overall health and wellbeing. To address these challenges, stakeholders need to develop innovative solutions that provide personalized and convenient dietary recommendations. The food recommender system with a chatbot offers a unique and effective solution that addresses these challenges. It utilizes advanced technology to analyze an individual's weight and BMI and provides personalized diet recommendations for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It also includes easy-to-follow recipes for each meal, making healthy eating more accessible and convenient for individuals. Overall, the business problem for stakeholders is to provide effective solutions that meet the needs of individuals in the highly competitive and crowded food and health industry. The food recommender system with a chatbot offers a unique and innovative solution that addresses the lack of personalized nutrition recommendations and the time and effort required to plan and prepare healthy meals.
